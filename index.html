				<li>Turing published "On Computable Numbers in 1936, essentially pioneering the idea of computer memory."</li>
				<li>He played a huge role in winning World War II. Turing began working at Bletchley Park, Britain’s secret headquarters for its codebreakers during World War II, in 1939. By one estimate, his work there may have cut the war short by up to two years. He’s credited with saving millions of lives.</li>
				<li>His greatest achievement was cracking the Enigma, a mechanical device used by the German army to encode secure messages.</li>
				<li>Turing was known to be eccentric. He wore a gas mask while riding his bike to combat his allergies.</li>
				<li>He also chain his cup of tea to a radiator to prevent his colleagues from stealing it.</li>
				<li>He rode his bike 60 miles to get to the first day of school. There was a train strike that day.</li>
				<li>He regularly ran the 31 miles between Cambridge and Ely while a student. He tried out for the Olympics.</li>
				<li>He was persecuted for being gay. After reporting a burglary at his home, the police investigation uncovered his relationship with another man. Homosexuality was illegal at the time, and he was charged with "gross indecency", and opted for chemical castration instead of serving jail time.</li>
				<li>His conviction received a royal pardon in 2013, and his role to the British war efforts were recognized.</li>
